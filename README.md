# PBH-EVAPORATION-PHOTON
Probing ultralight PBHs as DM from photon emisssion

PBHs in the asteroid mass range, i.e., 10^{17} -âˆ’ 10^{23} g, can make up the entirety of dark matter as the exclusion limits in that mass window are now refuted. We demonstrated that observations of low energy Galactic Center photons by the imminent soft gamma-ray telescopes, such as AMEGO, can probe this asteroid mass window. Assuming no evaporation signal will be detected, the projected exclusions from AMEGO can close this window by almost an order of magnitude for monochromatic non-rotating PBHs. For PBHs that have rotation or which follow an extended mass distribution, the projections probe much higher PBH masses.
